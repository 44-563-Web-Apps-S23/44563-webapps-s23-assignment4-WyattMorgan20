        <h2>The Last Straw</h2>
        <h3>By: Bosworth Crocker</h3>

        <h5>KARL.</h5> <p>[_Striking at_ FRITZI.] You're as big a tough as Henny Nies.</p>

        <h5>FRITZI.</h5> <p>[_Proud of this alleged likeness._]</p> <p>I'm going to be a man just
            like my father; I'll holler and make them stand around.</p>
            
        <h5>KARL.</h5> <p>[_With conviction._]</p> <p>What you need is a good licking.</p>
            
                <p>[_Telephone rings_; KARL _goes to it_.</p>
            
        <h5>KARL.</h5> <p>No, ma'am, we're just going to eat now.</p>
            
        <h5>FRITZI.</h5> <p>[_Sits down beside the table._]</p> <p>Blacky was a nice cat; she
            purred just like a steam-engine.</p>
            
        <h5>KARL.</h5> <p>Mama told you not to bring her in.</p>
            
        <h5>FRITZI.</h5> <p>Papa said I could.</p>
            
                <p>[_There is the sound of footfalls._ BAUER _and his wife come in and
                 close the door behind them_.</p>
