        <p>KARL. [_Striking at_ FRITZI.] You're as big a tough as Henny Nies.

            FRITZI. [_Proud of this alleged likeness._] I'm going to be a man just
            like my father; I'll holler and make them stand around.
            
            KARL. [_With conviction._] What you need is a good licking.
            
                 [_Telephone rings_; KARL _goes to it_.
            
            KARL. No, ma'am, we're just going to eat now.
            
            FRITZI. [_Sits down beside the table._] Blacky was a nice cat; she
            purred just like a steam-engine.
            
            KARL. Mama told you not to bring her in.
            
            FRITZI. Papa said I could.
            
                 [_There is the sound of footfalls._ BAUER _and his wife come in and
                 close the door behind them_.
